In this project, I worked with a couple of other students to demonstrate our knowledge in our Data Structures class. The final product was a database that allows users to input certain parameters and receive personalized movie recommendations. These parameters included genre, actors/actresses, directors, production companies, minimum and maximum year released, maximum duration, and others. Results were taken from a couple of files making up the entirety of the IMDB database, each containing 86,000 rows. In the end, users received their top 5 movies, which were sorted from highest to lowest based on a recommendation score.  Afterwards, the user could choose if they wanted the synopsis of any of the recommendations.  Furthermore, they could decide at the beginning whether to get only these recommendations, or be able to continuously receive more, which required a longer processing time.

In this project, we had to implement the main data structures by hand. My primary roles in the project were therefore to create the movie class, implement an unordered map to store the movies, and read in the file information. Some of the skills involved include:
- Understanding how to design unordered maps, including knowledge of hash tables and load capacity
- Comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of unordered maps when compared to similar data structures
- Understanding and optimizing time complexity
- Implementing constructors, destructors, and other members of the "Big Five"
- Utilizing pointers
- Using GitHub for version control among multiple users 

The time complexity aspect was very important. Ultimately, I was able to get my portion of the code to O(1) time complexity, and it generated the top 5 recommendations after evaluating the data in all 172,000 rows in less than 26 seconds.

Final score: 100%.
